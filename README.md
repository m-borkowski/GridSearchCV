## GridSearchCV

Grid-searching can be applied across machine learning to calculate the best parameters to use for any given model.

## Software and Libraries

Template code is provided in the notebook gridsearchcv-in-biomechanical-features.ipynb

Libraries used in this project:
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Sklearn
  
## Data descriptiom

Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (each one is a column):

  * pelvic incidence
  * pelvic tilt
  * lumbar lordosis angle
  * sacral slope
  * pelvic radius
  * grade of spondylolisthesis
